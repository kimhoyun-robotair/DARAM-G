# DARAM‑G 🚀

**DARAM‑G** stands for **Dynamic Autonomous Rover for Active Mapping – Geospatial**, and is the lunar exploration free-rover development project of IRRI (Inha Rocket Research Initiative).

## 🌟 Project Overview

1. **Visual-LiDAR SLAM** 📐
   - Based on RTAB‑Map, integrates a 2D LiDAR and RGB‑D camera to generate both a 2D Occupancy Grid Map and a 3D Visual Map simultaneously.

2. **Autonomous Exploration** 🧭
   - Implements real-time Path Planning and Path Tracking (Control) to autonomously explore key areas without human intervention. Built on the A* and Pure Pursuit algorithms.

3. **Autonomous Robotic Arm Control** 🤖
   - Uses the YOLO object-detection algorithm to identify operator-specified targets and performs motion planning to retrieve the target with the robotic arm.
